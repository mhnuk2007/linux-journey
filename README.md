# 🐧 My Linux Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Linux terminal learning log!  
I'm using this repository to track the commands I learn, my daily practice, and notes as I explore the Linux shell.

## 📜 What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first released by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. It powers everything from smartphones and smart TVs to supercomputers and servers. Due to its flexibility, robustness, and open-source nature, Linux has become the backbone of modern computing.

## 🧠 Why Ubuntu?

**Ubuntu** is one of the most popular Linux distributions, known for its user-friendliness and stability. Maintained by **Canonical Ltd.**, it's widely used for development, DevOps, and personal computing.

I'm currently using:

🖥️ **Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS**
