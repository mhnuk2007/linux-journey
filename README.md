## My Linux Journey

I have installed **Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS** on my PC and am actively practicing Linux commands.

I am following two Udemy courses simultaneously:
1. *Linux Command Line: From Zero to Hero* by **Pragmatic Programmer**
2. *Linux for Devops Engineers and Developers* by **Frank Anemaet**

# 🐧 My Linux Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Linux terminal learning log!  
I'm using this repository to track the commands I learn, my daily practice, and notes as I explore the Linux shell from scratch — all from an Android device using Termux. 📱💻
